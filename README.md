- 👋 Hi, I’m Lamek Amunyela (@Lamekatwork)
- 👀 I’m interested in embedded system design with my main focus being on the stm32 micrcontroller and FPGA. I have also a great interrest in robotic and AI
- I am currently learning how to design walking robots. I am currently working on the quadruped robot (now a very small sized one) and planning to make a 
- bigger quaduped or hexapod once the small version start working correctly. 
- I design PCB for my project from scratch using KiCad and if any one is having trouble working on PCB design with KiCAD, I can be of help. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and C# even if I have been developing all my project using either C or Python. I actually believe the two languages would be handy
- for most project (C++ for robotic coding and C# to easly create the PC -> robot interface)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Robotic design especially the controllers, gait manipulation and the likes.
